# Breaking Demeter

### An obnoxious (and mostly useless) study in the (im)proper selection of nested classes and collections

**Disclaimer**: Before engaging with these tests, you must agree that *outside of these tests* you will abide by the Law of Demeter at all times, or whenever possible. This test breaks the Law of Demeter many, many times.

Why then are we breaking a perfectly sound and just law?

So that we can practice selecting through nested classes and collections, of course! If you like learning lessons in the most obnoxious of ways then this is the perfect test collection for you!

Pass my tests by running the `demeter_test.rb` file.

Do not create helper methods.

You must only use indexes and the already created `attr_reader` methods in order to properly select what the test is asking for. Use pry if you'd like.

Have fun, and may the gods of Demeter have mercy upon my soul.
